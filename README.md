## The primary objectives are to:
-Identify the top 5 customers
-Track coffee-type sales trends
-Analyze sales by country

## Data Source
I used a publically available dataset and it had the below sheets in one Excel workbook
- Orders: Order details
- Customers: Customer profiles
- Products: Product information
- 
## Approach to Building the Dashboard
- Data Gathering & Cleaning: Combine customer and product details with orders for a comprehensive analysis.
- Data Transformation: Use formulas (VLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH) to merge data from different sheets, and treat columns for better usability.
- Dashboard Creation: Use pivot tables, slicers, and charts for an interactive analysis.
## Dashboard Overview
- Total Sales: Visualizes sales trends over time, organized by coffee type and date.
- Country Sales: Bar chart showing sales by country.
- Top 5 Customers: Highlights the top customers by sales.
## Summary of Data Quality Issues and Key Steps
- Combined key columns (Customer Name, Coffee Type, etc.) from different sheets using VLOOKUP, INDEX, and MATCH functions.
- Handled missing values and formatted columns (email, sales, coffee type, size, etc.).
- Created a dynamic table for future updates.
- Built interactive pivot tables and charts for detailed insights.
## Visualizations
- Line Chart: Sales trends by coffee type over time.
- Bar Chart: Sales by country and top 5 customers.
- Slicers: Interactive filters for data segmentation (size, roast type, loyalty card).
